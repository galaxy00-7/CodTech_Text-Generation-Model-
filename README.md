# 📝 Text Generation using GPT-2 - CodTech Internship Task 4

This project implements a **Text Generation Model** using the pre-trained **GPT-2** language model from Hugging Face Transformers. Built as part of **CodTech Internship Task 4**, the project demonstrates how transformer-based models can generate coherent paragraphs on various topics with just a simple prompt.

## 🧠 What is GPT-2?

**GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2)** is a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI. It can generate human-like text based on a prompt, making it useful for tasks like content generation, dialogue systems, and summarization.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Load and initialize the GPT-2 model and tokenizer using Hugging Face Transformers.
2. Define a text generation function that takes a topic or sentence prompt.
3. Generate and display coherent paragraphs based on various input topics.
